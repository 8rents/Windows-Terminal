## Installing on Windows

Windows terminal can be installed through scoop or direct download

### Install with scoop

1. Have scoop installed and run:

  ```bash
  scoop install windows-terminal
  ```

2. Then clone this repo to the following location:
  ```bash
%USERPROFILE%\scoop\apps\windows-terminal\current\settings
  ```

> *The cloned repo should be named `settings`*

All settings information is stored in the `settings.json` file. 

### Additional Directories in the `settings` folder
