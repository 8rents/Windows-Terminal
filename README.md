## Installing on Windows

Windows terminal can be installed through scoop or direct download

### Install with scoop

Have scoop installed and run

**For Scoop installs** this repo should be downloaded to:

```bash

```

All settings information is stored in the `settings.json` file. 

### Additional Directories in the `settings` folder

- [**fonts**](fonts/) -holds all of the custom fonts I'll be using in Windows Terminal.
- [**images**](images/) - Folder to hold different types of images
  - **[icons](images/icons)** - icons for the different shells (shows up in the list of shells)
  - **[backgrounds](images/backgrounds])** - Images that can be used as terminal backgrounds
    - **[animated](images\backgrounds\animated)** - Animated background images
- [**schemes**](schemes/) - Color Schemes 
- [**themes**](themes/) - *Same as old `schemes` directory.* Color (t)(sc)heme information. *These don't actually need to be stored as they are kept within the `settings.json`* file.
