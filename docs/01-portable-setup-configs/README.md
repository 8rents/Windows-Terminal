## Installing Windows Terminal as a portable app & Cloning Settings from GitHub

1. [**[Download the x86 image](https://aka.ms/terminal-canary-zip-x64)**]
2. [Clone settings from GitHub](https://github.com/8rents/Windows-Terminal)

**Name the downloaded folder `settings` and place it in the same directory as the exe and `.portable` file.**

All Changes I make to settings for Windows Terminal should go into the `settings` folder and be pushed to GitHub.
